This redevelopment of workflow and launch was funded by the European COST Action (CA 19126), under the virtual mobility grant. 
The author also acknowledges the funding from Israeli Ministry of Energy [grant number 221-11-037] that supported the development of the initial workflow, which is published in Journal of Physics: Conference Series. 
This revision and launch would not have been possible without the support from Prof. Maria-Beatrice Andreucci, Prof. Jonathan Natanian and Dr. Marco Delli Paoli.
